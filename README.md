To install, place the GexBot_QT.dll file (JUST BY ITSELF) into

YourQuantowerInstallationPath\Settings\Scripts\Indicators\FolderNameOfYourChoice 

So that it looks like

YourQuantowerInstallationPath\Settings\Scripts\Indicators\FolderNameOfYourChoice\GexBot_QT.dll


Then inside QT you can go to Custom -> FolderNameOfYourChoice to load the indicator. Make sure to set your API key in the indicator settings.
